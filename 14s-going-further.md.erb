Hopefully, the past chapters have given you a good overview of what's involved in building a Meteor app. So where do you go from now?

### Extra Chapters

First of all, if you haven't already done so you can purchase the [Full](https://gumroad.com/l/zIux) or [Premium](https://gumroad.com/l/OwKC) editions to unlock access to our extra chapters. These chapters will walk you through real-world scenarios such as building an API for your app, integrating with third-party services, and migrating your data. 

### Meteor Manual

In addition to the official [documentation](http://docs.meteor.com), the [Meteor Manual](http://manual.meteor.com/) digs deeper into specific topics such as Tracker and Blaze. 

### Evented Mind

If you'd like to take a deeper dive into the intricacies of Meteor, we also strongly recommend checking out Chris Mather's [Evented Mind](https://www.eventedmind.com), a video learning platform with over 50 individual Meteor videos (and new videos being added every week).  

### MeteorHacks

One of the best ways to keep up with Meteor is to subscribe to Arunoda Susiripala's [MeteorHacks](http://meteorhacks.com/)' weekly newsletter. The MeteorHacks blog is also a great source for advanced Meteor tips. 

### Atmosphere

[Atmosphere](http://atmospherejs.com), Meteor's unofficial package repository, is another great place to learn more: you can discover new packages and take a look at their code to see what patterns people are using. 

(Disclaimer: Atmosphere is maintained in part by Tom Coleman, one of the authors of this book.)

### Meteorpedia

[Meteorpedia](http://www.meteorpedia.com/) is a wiki for all things Meteor. And of course, it's built with Meteor!

### The Meteor Podcast

Josh and Ry from Meteor shop [Differential](http://differential.io) record [the Meteor Podcast](http://www.meteorpodcast.com/) every week, and it's another great way to keep up with what's going on in the Meteor community. 

### Other Resources

Stephan Hochhaus has compiled a pretty exhaustive list of [Meteor resources](http://yauh.de/articles/376/best-learning-resources-for-meteorjs). 

[Manuel Schoebel](http://www.manuel-schoebel.com/blog/)'s blog is another nice source of Meteor posts. And so is the [Gentlenode blog](http://journal.gentlenode.com/).

### Getting Help

If you run into a stumbling block, the best place to ask is [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com). Make sure you tag your question with the `meteor` tag. 

### Community

Finally, the best way to stay up to date with Meteor is to be active in the community. We recommend signing up for the Meteor [mailing list](https://www.meteor.com/), following the [Meteor Core](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/meteor-core) and [Meteor Talk](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/meteor-talk) Google Groups, and creating an account on Meteor forum [Crater.io](http://crater.io/).
