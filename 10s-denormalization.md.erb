Denormalizing data means not storing that data in a "normal" form. In other words, denormalization means having multiple copies of the same piece of data hanging about. 

In the last chapter, we denormalized the count of the number of comments into the post object to avoid having to load all the comments all the time. In a data modelling sense this is redundant, as we could instead just count the correct set of comments at any time to figure out that value (leaving out performance considerations).

Denormalizing often means extra work for the developer. In our example, every time we add or remove a comment we'll also need to remember to update the relevant post to ensure that the `commentsCount` field stays accurate. This is exactly why relational databases such as MySQL frown upon this approach.

However, the normal approach also has its drawbacks: without a `commentsCount` property, we'd need to send _all_ comments down the wire at all times just to be able to count them, which is what we were doing in the beginning. Denormalizing lets us avoid this entirely.

### A Special Publication

It *would* be possible to create a special publication that only sends down the comment counts that we are interested in (i.e. comment counts of posts that we can currently see, via aggregate queries on the server). 

But it's worth considering if the complexity of such publication code would not outweigh the difficulties created by denormalizing…

Of course, such considerations are application-specific: if you are writing code where data integrity is of paramount importance, then avoiding data inconsistencies is far more important and of a higher priority to you than performance gains.

### Embedding Documents or Using Multiple Collections

If you are experienced with Mongo, you might have been surprised to see that we created a second collection just for comments: why not just embed the comments in a list within the post document?

It turns out that many of the tools Meteor gives us work a lot better when operating at the collection level. For example:

1. The `{{#each}}` helper is very efficient when iterating over a cursor (the result of `collection.find()`). The same is not true when it iterates over an array of objects within a larger document.
2. `allow` and `deny` operate at the document level, and thus make it easy to ensure that any modifications of individual comments are correct in a way that would be more complex if we operated at a post level.
3. DDP operates at the level of top-level attributes of a document--this would mean if `comments` was a property of a `post`, every time a comment was created on a post, the server would send the entire updated comment list of that post out to each connected client.
4. Publications and subscriptions are a lot easier to control at the level of documents. For example, if we wanted to paginate comments on a post we would find it difficult to do so unless comments were in their own collection.

Mongo suggests embedding documents in order to reduce the number of expensive queries to fetch documents. However, this is less of an issue when we take into account Meteor's architecture: most of the time we are querying comments on the *client*, where database access is essentially free.

### The Downsides of Denormalization

There's a good argument to be made that you *shouldn't* denormalize your data. For a good look at the case against denormalization, we recommend [Why You Should Never Use MongoDB](http://www.sarahmei.com/blog/2013/11/11/why-you-should-never-use-mongodb/) by Sarah Mei.
